-- This migration has been disabled to prevent duplicate system role creation
-- System roles are now managed exclusively by the Java DataSeeder component
-- which provides better error handling and logging capabilities.

-- The following roles are created by DataSeeder.java:
-- - Owner: Full access to all operations across the system
-- - Manager: Can view/edit users, view organization, approve requests, and generate reports  
-- - User: Can view and edit own profile only
-- - Operator: System operations and monitoring capabilities
